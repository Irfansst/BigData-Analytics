This projects contains some real world use cases using map reduce design patterns:
-


### TopK 
Given a set of (key-as-string, value-as-integer) pairs, then finding a Top-N ( where N > 0)list is a Filtering design pattern (you filter out data and find top-10 list).


### Secondary Sorting and Composite Key
MapReduce framework automatically sorts the keys generated by mappers, but values passed to each reducer are not sorted at all and they can be in
any order.The goal of the secondary sort is to give some ordering for the values received by a reducer. So,once we apply/inject secondary sort to our MapReduce paradigm, then we will have:

list(values) = (S1,S2,S3,...Sn)
such that

S1 < S2 < S3...< Sn (ascending order)
S1 > S2 > S3...> Sn (descending order)


### Filtering
Filtering patterns all find a subset of data, whether it be small, like a top-ten listing,or large, like the results of a de-duplication.
Filtering simply evaluates each record separately and decides, based on some condition, whether it should stay or go.
Sampling, one common application of filtering, is about pulling out a sample of the data,such as the highest values for a particular field or a few random records.


### Summarization (Min,Max,Average)
Calculating some sort of aggregate over groups in your data set is a great way to easily extract value right away.The summarizations pattern is a general pattern for calculating aggregate statistical values over your data.


### Friend Recommendation
Social network have  millions of users, Common Friend Recommendation is to implement a MapReduce program to identify common friends among all pairs of users. Let U be a set of all users: {U 1 , U 2 , ..., U n }. 
Then the goal is to find common friends for every pair of (U i , U j ) where i â‰  j.


### Joining (both Map side and Reducer side)
