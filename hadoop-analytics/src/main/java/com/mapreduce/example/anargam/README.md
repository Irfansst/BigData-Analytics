What is an Anagram?
===================
Anagram is a word or phrase made by transposing the letters of another 
word or phrase.  An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging 
the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all 
the original letters exactly once; for example, the word "anagram" can be 
rearranged into "nagaram". Someone who creates anagrams may be called an 
"anagrammatist".

Programs
========
The purpose of these MapReduce programs  (Hadoop and Spark) is to find anagrams 
for a set of given  documents.

We will ignore words if their length is less than N (we read N as a parameter).
